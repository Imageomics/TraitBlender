##IN PROGRESS

### Task 1
Fix the erroneous button in the "Select Mesh Function" part of the menu.

### Task 2
Fix the weird warning when importing the mesh function CSV.

### Task 3
Maybe add the ability to hide individual background planes?

### Task 4
After you hide an individual sun, you can no longer use the "hide all suns" button properly; it will only hide/unhide the last hidden sun. Fix this.

### Task 5
Sometimes the object does not show up in the final render even though it is apparent in the camera view. This seems to mostly happen when the background planes are present; they may be in the way for the render but not the camera.

### Task 6
Sometimes textures aren't exported or look funny when viewed in other 3D viewports.

### Task 7
Need docstrings and other function/operator documentation.

### Task 8
Need to clean up the generating loop with the new operators.

### Task 9
Make a Docker image.

### Task 10
Publish to Blender addons catalogue.
- Publishing instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Process/Addons/Guidelines "Publishing Requirements").

### Task 11
Fix it so that backgrounds can be scaled on single axes, they currently only scale on all 3 at once

##COMPLETE
